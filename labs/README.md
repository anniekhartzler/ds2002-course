## Submitting Labs

Labs will be released under "Assignments" on Canvas. The Canvas assignment will provide a link with specific instructions. [Gists](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists) are special Git repositories and a great way to share code snippets like your lab submissions.

To submit your work, follow these instructions:

1. Sign in to GitHub
2. Create a new **secret** Gist. If you're not familiar with Gist, don't worry. We will go through the process for Lab 1 during class together. 
3. You can clone and work with this Gist like a Git repository. 
4. Save your work in your GitHub Gist. Copy and Paste the Gist URL to the Lab assignment in Canvas and submit for grading. You can submit multiple times until the assignment closes on its due date. So pay attention to that.
